\b0 \uc0\u8232 by HAKIM BISHARA May 6, 2020\u8232 Hakim Bishara is a staff writer for Hyperallergic and co-director of the artist-run gallery Soloway in Brooklyn, New York. He is a recipient of the 2020 Andy Warhol Foundation | Creative Capital Arts Writers Grant.\u8232 \u8232 \u8232 The rich online resource, spearheaded by researcher Nicola Pratt, reveals how culture was \'93an outlet\'94 for political views during the revolution and its aftermath.\u8232 February 11 in 2011 was a day that Egyptians waited decades to see. After less than a month of widespread popular protests, the country\'92s ruler of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak, stepped down. The Arab Spring was well on its way, heralding a new era of democratic revolutions in the region. But that sense of euphoria didn\'92t last for long and the struggle for freedom has since devolved into chaos and wars.\
At the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, researcher Nicola Pratt spearheaded a project to archive the Egyptian revolution of 2011 through the prism of art and popular culture. \'93Politics, Popular Culture and the 2011 Egyptian Revolution\'94 is a free online resource than spans more than 200 items of visual art, performance, photography, graffiti, music, TV, and film made during the uprising and its aftermath.\
\'93Music, graffiti, satire and film all played a vital role in giving Egyptians an outlet for their political views during the 2011 revolution and its aftermath, but by their very nature these things can be ephemeral,\'94 Pratt, who teaches International Politics of the Middle East at the Warwick\'92s Department of Politics & International Studies, said in a statement. \'93Our archive captures a snapshot of these popular responses to the Revolution and, we hope, not only will preserve them as valuable records for future researchers in the face of official attempts to impose a historical narrative, but also to spark the interest of new students of history and politics.\'94\uc0\u8232 Pratt compiled the archive with the help of Dalia Mostafa, a lecturer in Arabic and Comparative Literature at the University of Manchester; Dina Rezk, a lecturer in Middle Eastern History at the University of Reading; and Sara Salem, previously a research and teaching fellow in Middle East Politics at Warwick and now a lecturer in sociology at the London School of Economics.\
Users can browse the archive by theme, media type, or timeline of the revolution. It also includes study guides for independent learners and teachers.\
One of the archived works of performance is artist Laila Soliman\'92s 2011 \'93No Time for Art (A Salute to the Martyrs and the Living),\'94 which commemorates the stories of victims of police brutality during the protests through a theatrical performance. The archive also features a collection of political cartoons and works of graffiti, which were some of the more common expressions of resistance during the revolution.\uc0\u8232 In addition, the online archive is rife with images from Tahrir Square in Cairo, the epicenter of the 2011 protests. One of the largest photographic collections in the archive belongs to journalist and blogger Hossam El-Hamalawy, who continued to chronicle protests in the square through 2013.\
In the documentary section, the archive features dozen of films, including Ahmed Rashwan\'92s Born on the 25th of January (2011) which tracks four months of the revolutions through the director\'92s eyes. The section also includes Mostafa Fathi\'92s Egyptian Tank Man, a viral video showing a lone Egyptian protester confronting an armored tank that used a water cannon to disperse the crowds.\
Warwick\'92s collection also pays attention to other archival projects like Tahrir Documents, an archive of activist papers translated to English, and Amira Hanafi\'92s interactive \'93Dictionary of the Revolution\'94 (2017) which documented the way Egyptians perceive key terms of the revolution. Hanafi has woven imagined dialogues based on tens of interviews she conducted with ordinary citizens.\
Nine years after the uprising, Egypt is again ruled by a military strongman, General Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who assumed power in a coup d\'92etat in 2013. Is there still hope for the revolution? \'93Be patient, Egypt,\'94 said poet Tamim al-Barghouti, whose spoken-word poem is included in the archive, \'93The light of day is about to emerge.\'94\uc0\u8232 \u8232

\b0 by KACKPER GRASS 
\b  
\b0 November 26, 2018\uc0\u8232 He is a postgraduate student with an academic background in language, literature, and political science. During his studies, he gained several years of experience working in the field of foreign language education, both in the United States and Europe. He is a writer on the subject of art history, focusing particularly on Latin American and Spanish modernist movements. Apart from pursuing his personal research and publications, he currently works as an ESL teacher and editor. \
Marxist, Nationalist, Feminist \'96 these are words that describe not only the political convictions but also the artwork of Frida Kahlo. Although born as Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calder\'f3n outside of Mexico City in 1907, Kahlo eventually shortened her name and frequently told people that she was born in 1910, the year that widespread political unrest finally culminated in the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution.\
After nine and a half years of conflict, the revolution resulted in a dramatic shift in Mexican politics and culture. The ousting of the ruling elite paved the way for a new constitution, which in turn resulted in radical land reforms, equal pay laws for women, and the introduction of socialist currents to the country\'92s political landscape.\uc0\u8232 The Revolutionary Artist\
Growing up in the fervor of the revolution, Kahlo was deeply inspired by the resurgence of national pride and the spread of progressive ideas that followed. Her work Moses, painted as a reaction to Sigmund Freud\'92s book Moses and Monotheism, exemplifies many of these social and political attitudes. Namely, the central focus of the mural is the symbolization of the female reproductive organs along with the sun and the rain as the universal givers of life. The top left corner is dedicated to Mexico\'92s indigenous Aztec culture, which is placed on an even level with representations of ancient Egyptian civilization as well as the Greek, Hebrew, and Christian religions of classical antiquity. Below the level of the gods is that of people whom Kahlo considered to be great historical figures: Stalin, Lenin, Marx, Gandhi, and Christ, amongst others. It is interesting to note the ironic inclusion of Hitler, whom the artist referred to as the \'93lost child,\'94 within this group. Finally, the bottom level depicts a tumultuous representation of the masses as a symbol of human and societal evolution.\uc0\u8232 Apart from the Mexican Revolution, perhaps the greatest source of inspiration in Kahlo\'92s life was her lifelong partner Diego Rivera. The two artists married in 1929 and moved to the United States the following year. While her husband was busy painting a number of commissioned works, Kahlo grew increasingly homesick and unhappy over the course of their three-year stay. On a more political level, this period made her quite critical of the United States, which she viewed as the embodiment of exploitative industrialization and capitalism.\u8232 Her Self-Portrait on the Borderline Between Mexico and the United States illustrates a clear dichotomy between the two countries. The Mexican side is represented by colorful images of nature, history, and cultural heritage, whereas a landscape of dull grey factories and pollution is used to represent the United States. While the flag in Kahlo\'92s left hand makes it clear where the artist\'92s loyalties lie, it is important to note the electricity generator that supplies power to the pedestal that reads \'93Carmen Rivera painted her portrait in the year of 1932.\'94 Equally important is the fact that the same generator is parasitically attached to the roots of the plants on the other side of the border, an allusion to the exploitative nature of the United States\'92 relationship with its southern neighbors.\u8232 Although one of Rivera\'92s commissions was to paint Man at the Crossroads, a mural in praise of industrial advancement for the Rockefeller Center, Kahlo expressed her views on the topic in a much different way. My Dress Hangs There takes the form of a disorderly collage of commercial advertisements, celebrity culture, and social unrest against the backdrop of a concrete jungle where modern skyscrapers mix with kitsch Greek structures and a medieval church. In effect, it appears that the only authentic item in this chaotic scene is the artist\'92s traditional Tehuana dress, the focal point of the work.\u8232 Despite being a high-ranking member of the Mexican Communist Party for several years before his tour of the United States, an ideological dispute with other members of the central committee ultimately led to Rivera\'92s expulsion in 1929. In solidarity with her husband, Kahlo also left the pro-Stalinist party, and the couple\'92s political sympathies began to shift in support of the exiled Leon Trotsky over the next several years. In 1937, they managed to persuade the leftist government of President L\'e1zaro C\'e1rdenas to grant Trotsky and his wife, Natalia Sedova, asylum in Mexico and invited the couple to stay with them in La Casa Azul, Frida Kahlo\'92s family home. Nonetheless, Rivera\'92s discovery that Trotsky and Kahlo were having an affair, one of many infidelities that marked the couple\'92s troubled marriage, forced Trotsky to seek refuge elsewhere.\u8232 Upon moving out of Casa Azul, at the request of his wife, Trotsky left behind a self-portrait that Kahlo had painted for his fifty-eighth birthday. In the painting, Kahlo presents herself in a stately and seductive manner, holding a paper that reads \'93To Leon Trotsky, with all my love, I dedicate this painting on the 7th of November 1937. Frida Kahlo in San \'c1ngel, Mexico.\'94 The Russian couple eventually managed to find a residence not far from Casa Azul, but in May 1940 a failed attempt on Trotsky\'92s life was carried out by the Soviet agent Iosif Grigulevich and the muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, who remained loyal to the Mexican Communist Party after Rivera\'92s departure. Nonetheless, the second attempt, this time executed by the Spanish agent Ram\'f3n Mercader in August of the same year, was successful. Leon Trotsky died in Mexico City on August 21st, 1940.\u8232 Following Stalin\'92s death in March 1953, Kahlo began work on a painting in his honor. Her self-portrait with the \'93Great Leader\'94 elevates Stalin to a position of almost religious importance, a status he held throughout his thirty-year rule in the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, despite her reverence, Kahlo was unable to paint the portrait with the precision and clarity of her previous works, as severe pain from a bus accident in her youth and a lifetime of other health problems required her to take increasingly stronger medications that affected her artistic technique.\u8232 In her final days, Kahlo painted her last political work, Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick. Suffering from constant pain, declining health, and the impediments of heavy medications, Kahlo depicts Marx as a god-like being who is about to take her to heaven while at the same time punish the unjust forces of capitalism and imperialism. Knowing that she is about to die, Kahlo strips her top to reveal the leather corset that had been supporting her broken back since the bus accident and drops her crutches to grasp not a Bible but a little red book\'97the Communist Manifesto. Frida Kahlo died on July 13th, 1954 in Mexico City. The following day, a public procession accompanied her body, draped in a flag featuring the hammer and sickle, from the Palacio de Bellas Artes to the Pante\'f3n Civil de Dolores, where she was cremated. Indeed, her last wish was to be remembered as the stern and unshakable revolutionary whom Diego Rivera had painted at the center of The Arsenal a year before they got married, distributing arms to her countrymen in preparation for the next Mexican Revolution.\u8232 \u8232

\b0 by PAUL BLACK   1 February 2014\uc0\u8232 Biography not found\
Hannah H\'f6ch was a pioneer Dadaist of 1920\'92s Berlin. Somewhat forgotten, or at least pigeon-holed by art history; a social provocateur who clashed with the Nazis and was found guilty of Entartete Kunst(degenerate art).\
The exhibition is a survey of the artist\'92s works on paper and is the first major exhibition of H\'f6ch\'92s art in Great Britain, bringing together over 100 works from major international collections. The exhibition examines H\'f6ch\'92s career from the 1910\'92s to the 1970\'92s \'96 if circumnavigating her prolific array of oil painting and drawing \'96 the exhibition at least focuses on her most remembered output \'96 photo-montage and collage \'96 and her works of \'91fantastische kunst\'92.  \
 H\'f6ch\'92s art was often an astute social satire on the female form, and the politics of Europe. The artist\'92s  human condition is resolutely female, and reflects her own experiences. A reflection of the female form and identity in society, as well as art.\
 These were figurative abstractions of tension and urgency. A juxtaposition of formal abstract aesthetics and emotional socio-cultural clout \'96 initially reflecting a period of enthusiasm and great change in a post First World War Berlin.\
Yet H\'f6ch\'92s art was radical in contrast to the purely formal concerns of the Dadaist movement. The \'91simultaneous muddle of noises\'92 that the Dada Manifesto called for was discarded by H\'f6ch for a certain aesthetic balance, a definite composition, and a narrative structure, often politicised.\
This one-woman Dadaist revolution also reflected a more obvious socio-political content and feminist drive, prevalent in the creative party of 1920\'92s Berlin, eventually to be trampled under booted heel by a \'91mad, inhuman, bestial clique\'92 \'96 as the artist herself described the Nazis \'96 once she was no longer muted by their tyranny.\
In fact the Second World War saw the artist publicly derided for her degenerate works and she lived out the war in cautious seclusion. A period that saw no public displays of her work, or opinion. Yet her art was spared exhibition in Die Ausstellung Entartete Kunst \'96 the Degenerate Art exhibition of 1937 \'96 as many of her peers fled Europe to America to continue the movement.  \
But it was the compositional harmony of H\'f6ch\'92s work as opposed to the \'91anti-art\'92 of the Dada aesthetic that may have been the reason for her seeming erasure from  Dadaist history. It was in the 1920\'92s that fellow Dadaists John Heartfield, and George Grosz decried her inclusion in the First International Dada Fair.\
Also the fact that fellow German Dadaists considered their female peers \'91charming and gifted amateurs\'92, suggests that left-wing art movements were not spared sexism even in a progressive Berlin.\
H\'f6ch was also an artist exploring the contradictions of her own identity juxtaposed against a society in either post-war ascension or decline, whether in the darkening clouds of a pre-war Berlin with a tableaux of a fluid sexuality and social conscience, or with more than a glimmer of biting satirical wit.  \
The \'91Ethnographic Museum\'92 series, in which large heads from African sculptures appear on bodies of European women have encouraged a didactic response amongst art historians in the past, suggesting that these works offer a critique of Germany\'92s imperial sojourns into Africa.\
If anything they were more likely to be a reference to the endless use of the female form in art, juxtaposing the totemic iconography of a \'91fertile\'92 African aesthetic of the time with the social freedoms of a 1920\'92s Berlin \'96 but with the slight nuance of exploitation.\
There are certainly references to the gaze of the viewer and objectification of the female form, and it\'92s socially disempowering consequences, bringing to mind; \'91The surveying woman is a man, the surveyed woman is a woman\'92, a notion that H\'f6ch would probably agree with, if not the language with which the concept is posited.\
The stark nature of racial inequality in a 1930\'92s Germany was also referenced on several occasions in the artist\'92s work \'96 a courageous act in the period of the Weimar republic.\
There is also an anachronistic tendency to read a feminist agenda when viewing the works \'96 yet the female figures of H\'f6ch\'92s photo-montages often express a knowing place, not only within the composition, but in history, both art history and cultural history; while creating mischief in their own social present.\
H\'f6ch was not a follower of the strict formalist theory of Dadaism \'96  hers was a detail of arrangement \'96 abstracted social-conceptual imagery \'96 often focusing on the female form and with a political vibrancy \'96 a power to excite an anarchic aesthetic reflecting a period of tumultuous social upheaval.\
But post World War Two H\'f6ch\'92s insightful and piercing aesthetic softened into lyrical abstraction. The artist\'92s anarchic social criticism was worn down by the fear of Nazi oppression \'96 or maybe this was a reflection of a new found social and artistic freedom; her social commentary was quieter and her \'91attacks\'92 less ferocious.\
One of the artist\'92s final works; \'91Lebensbild (Life Portrait) 1973\'92, Is a complex photo-montage including images of H\'f6ch throughout her career. Having lived through one of the most eventful centuries in human history, she embraced the new media of \'91photo-matter\'92 often using it to comment on the very subjects it had captured.\
Amongst the detailed collage is an almost hidden image from the Apollo moon landings and the famous image of \'91Earth Rise\'92. H\'f6ch\'92s figure is collaged into the image as an almost final act of mischief and a clever narrative of artist as attestor to the world. Human action processed through the eye of the artist as social conscience and political commentator of unmediated expression. \
As H\'f6ch is not only observing the moon landing but peering over the shoulder of the astronaut, with magnifying glass in hand looking back at, and observing the earth. The most objective view of ourselves in history. A conceit to a lifetime of critical study and manipulation of the photograph, and a modest, almost hidden statement of witness to a lifetime of change, and an artist\'92s moral obligation.\uc0\u8232 \u8232

Here she uses cuttings from newspapers and magazines to create one cohesive image out of a myriad of disparate parts.\u8232 \

70 miles north of the US\'96Mexico border, Other TARGET/s condemns migrant detention, mass incarceration, and the juvenile justice system, by reaffirming a sense of shared humanity.\uc0\u8232 TUCSON, Arizona \'97 Amidst our sociopolitical environment of hostility, racism, dehumanization, and lack of compassion, there is an ongoing necessity to speak truth to power, to examine its mechanisms of division and domination, and its desperation to maintain the fragile legitimacy of social order. Simultaneously, the degrading manipulations and rhetorical schemes of entrenched power structures must be resisted by telling stories that instead reaffirm a sense of shared humanity, belonging, dignity, and respect for differences. The group exhibition Other TARGET/s at the University of Arizona Museum of Art \'97 featuring work by sheri crider, Gabriela Mu\'f1oz, M. Jenea Sanchez, and Shontina Vernon \'97 attempts to take on that dual task.\
Displayed prominently in the gallery, crider\'92s \'93Nontactical Monument for Reparations\'94 is a sculptural replica of rescue beacons that US Customs and Border Protection has mounted in the harsh deserts of Arizona where thousands of border crossers have died in the past 20 years. Beneath its blue siren, a bound stack of papers lists death reports of detainees who have perished in ICE custody. This combination by crider reinforces the complicated function of the beacons: yes, they can save lives, but rescue also often leads to detainment \'97 and, increasingly, indefinite detention.\
This and other pieces establish a certain place-specificity of the exhibition: Tucson is a major focal point in immigration debates, due to its location only 70 miles from the US-Mexico border and within an hour of five migrant detention centers \'97 four of which are run by private for-profit companies.\uc0\u8232 The prison-industrial complex is addressed in crider\'92s wall installation \'93Arizona \'97 The Grand Carceral State,\'94 an array of 66 commemorative plates, 15 of which are commercial souvenirs crider gathered, and the rest are ceramic imitations she created. Their imagery ranges from tourist kitsch about the Grand Canyon, to incisive commentary on WWII internment camps, the anti-immigrant sheriff Joe Arpaio, and related issues. While the installation\'92s shape in the state outline may be a bit heavy-handed, its operative confusion of actual versus fictitious objects feels like a crucial caution against normalizing such dehumanizing actions and policies.\
For crider, focusing on the scope of mass incarceration is informed by her own past experience of being imprisoned. Her painting \'93Cibola Detention Center, Five years, $150mil, Silence still equals death,\'94 stitches together references to trans pride symbols, queer activism, and the mistreatment of transgender women and non-binary migrants held at the Cibola facility in New Mexico. Meanwhile, Vernon\'92s short film \'93Grrrl Justice\'94 looks at girls and queer youth of color who have been impacted by the juvenile justice system. We see three protagonists move through vignettes of alienation, abuse, and homophobic harassment, but ultimately emerge to assert their own agency and voice.\uc0\u8232 Such portraits of resiliency also connect to Sanchez and Mu\'f1oz\'92s work with women in the border town of Agua Prieta, Mexico. In particular, six large color photographs carry a commanding presence in the gallery. Part of Sanchez\'92s larger project \'93The Mexican Woman\'92s Post-Apocalyptic Survival Guide to the Southwest: Food, Clothing, Shelter, y la Migra,\'94 these compelling images present women of color in a space of empowerment where they tend the land, hone energy conservation and water preservation techniques, and hold meetings and workshops in an adobe brick building they constructed themselves. Additional sculptures and a short video, all produced by Sanchez and Mu\'f1oz together, point to ways that the women preserve and pass along familial knowledge. While cumulatively documenting the generosity and shared labor through which these women thrive together, these works also accomplish something else beyond merely showing: depicting their subjects with grace and dignity, they hold space for the women to be active contributors to their own representation and craft bold counter-narratives to the forces that seek to diminish their humanity.\u8232 \u8232

\b0 by CATH POUND  Sept 24 2018\uc0\u8232 Biography not found\u8232 \
Many German artists entered World War I enthusiastically, believing it would bring about positive social change. However, the horrors they experienced in the trenches, and their country\'92s humiliating defeat, left them bitter and disillusioned at the seemingly futile bloodletting. In the aftermath, the freedom of form and color associated with pre-war Expressionism seemed out of touch with the pervasive post-war cynicism. In this context, many artists turned toward a new kind of realism with a biting satirical edge, a style which came to be known as Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity).\
The movement never had a formal manifesto; it took its name from a 1923 exhibition at the Kunsthalle Mannheim organized by director Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub. Hartlaub featured artists working in a diverse range of styles, including Georg Schrimpf, George Grosz, Otto Dix, Max Beckmann, and Alexander Kanoldt, but felt their work embodied a purely German aesthetic.\uc0\u8232 At the same time, art critic Franz Roh referred to the style as \'93Magic Realism,\'94 which he saw as a far more pan-European movement that incorporated the classicizing retour \'e0 l\'92ordre (return to order) aesthetic of Pablo Picasso and Andr\'e9 Derain in Paris, as well as the metaphysical art of Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carr\'e0 in Italy. The influence of de Chirico certainly had an impact on many German artists, who adapted his eerie, featureless figures into their own works.\
Matthew Gale, co-curator of the exhibition \'93Magic Realism: Art in Weimar Germany 1919\'9633\'94 at Tate Modern in London, suggested that Magic Realism has become so inextricably linked with Germany because of \'93the social and political plunge\'85the total collapse of structures by which society was held together,\'94 which most acutely affected that country. This upheaval inspired German artists to turn a uniquely harsh mirror on their rapidly changing society. \uc0\u8232 Though not unified by a manifesto, the work of artists such as Grosz, Dix, and Beckmann, along with Rudolf Schlichter and Jeanne Mammen, shows a tension between the increasing freedoms of their modernizing society and the trauma and devastation caused by war.\
Dix was particularly attuned to the horrors of battle and the manner in which the German people had spurned those who fought for their country. In The War (1924)\'97his viscerally powerful portfolio of prints based largely on his own harrowing experiences as a soldier\'97Dix exploits the corrosive nature of etching and aquatint to heighten the sense of decay in his portrayals of bomb-blasted landscapes and decomposing bodies. The appalling human cost of World War I is shown to brutally satirical effect in The Skat Players \'96 Card Playing War Invalids (1920). Featuring three appallingly injured soldiers, Dix\'92s painting suggests that war is nothing more than a gamble played between men. \uc0\u8232 In The Night (1919), Beckmann reveals his own nihilistic worldview. Though not a battle scene, the painting depicts a man being brutally strangled while his wife is seen stripped and bound to a beam with a clear suggestion that she has been raped. The claustrophobic and angular environment seems to entrap both victims and aggressors, offering no escape from the pointless suffering.\
Post-war society appeared to offer new opportunities to women, both professionally and socially, and Weimar\'92s famous cabaret scene, which welcomed gay men and women, posited a relaxing of conservative morals. Yet there was a sense among artists that these liberties came at the expense of weaker members of society, particularly war veterans. At the same time, women\'92s new economic and social power aroused antipathy among certain artists.\
The central panel of Dix\'92s triptych Metropolis (1927\'9628) features a raucous nightclub scene in which an archetypal \'93new woman,\'94 identified by her fashionable flapper outfit and closely cropped haircut, flaunts her newfound social freedom, while in the left and right panels, homeless, war-injured cripples are ignored by a series of gaudily attired prostitutes. In Grosz\'92s Suicide (1916), the action seems to have played out on a stage; the two men performed their deaths for the benefit of a prostitute, who gazes out indifferently from a curtained window.\uc0\u8232 This antagonism towards women also manifests in the disturbingly prevalent lustmord (lust murder) genre that emerged during this time. Paintings such as Rudolf Schlichter\'92s The Artist with Two Hanged Women (1924) fetishize sexual violence against women while superficially condemning it. \
In marked contrast, the work of Jeanne Mammen, a successful professional artist and quintessential \'93new woman,\'94 shows \'93an awareness of the place that women were staking out in society,\'94 Gale said. Independent and intelligent, Mammen\'92s women wait languidly for something to entertain them in Boring Dolls (1929) and offer their own critique of the war in At the Shooting Gallery (1929), in which a fairground assistant hands a gun to a male customer, her expression revealing an unreserved contempt for the damage she knows boys can wreak with their toys.\uc0\u8232 Although Dix produced works in the lustmord genre himself, he also offered one of the defining images of the liberated Weimar woman in his Portrait of the journalist Sylvia von Harden (1926). Like many artists of the time, Dix chose sitters who could portray certain archetypes. Harden\'92s androgynous appearance\'97her cropped hair and monocle are complemented by her insouciant manner and cigarette\'97was representative to Dix of an entire epoch. Christian Schad\'92s Self Portrait with Model (1927) incorporates another strikingly modern woman in an image that questions notions of identity and appearance. Both paintings show a fascination with Old Master techniques and conventions; many artists turned their attention to craftsmanship as a means of dealing with the chaos around them.\u8232 Although Dix produced works in the lustmord genre himself, he also offered one of the defining images of the liberated Weimar woman in his Portrait of the journalist Sylvia von Harden (1926).

\b0 by HOLLAND COTTER        Feb. 20 2020\uc0\u8232 Holland Cotter is co-chief art critic of The New York Times, where he has been on staff since 1998. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 2009. He writes on a wide range of art, old and new, and he has made extended trips to Africa and China for The Times. A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he has degrees from Harvard College, Columbia University and the City University of New York.\u8232 \
From floated proposal to finished product, \'93Vida Americana: Mexican Muralists Remake American Art, 1925-1945\'94 at the Whitney Museum of American Art represents a decade of hard thought and labor, and the effort has paid off. The show is stupendous, and complicated, and lands right on time. Just by existing it accomplishes three vital things. It reshapes a stretch of art history to give credit where credit is due. It suggests that the Whitney is, at last, en route to fully embracing \'93American Art.\'94 And it offers yet another argument for why the build-the-wall mania that has obsessed this country for the past three-plus years just has to go. Judging by the story told here, we should be actively inviting our southern neighbor northward to enrich our cultural soil.\
That story, a hemispheric one, begins in Mexico in the 1920s. After 10 years of civil war and revolution, that country\'92s new constitutional government turned to art to invent and broadcast a unifying national self-image, one that emphasized both its deep roots in indigenous, pre-Hispanic culture and the heroisms of its recent revolutionary struggles.\
The chosen medium for the message was mural painting \'97 monumental, accessible, anti-elitist, in the public domain. And three very differently gifted practitioners quickly came to dominate the field: Diego Rivera, Jos\'e9 Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros: \'93Los Tres Grandes\'94 \'97 \'93the three great ones\'94 \'97 as they came to be known among admirers.\
Many of those admirers were artists in the United States. Some had heard word of a lush, affordable, artist-honoring tropical utopia, and traveled south to experience it for themselves. Others, alert to social inequities rampant under United States capitalism \'97 to be laid bare by the Great Depression \'97 wanted to make art a tool for social change and took the Mexican revolutionary experiment as a model.\uc0\u8232 For all parties, the model was an exhilarating one, and the bright pink walls of the exhibition\'92s opening gallery suggest a fiesta atmosphere, as do the paintings gathered there: Alfredo Ramos Mart\'ednez\'92s 1929 image of an itinerant flower vendor bending under her load of calla lilies; a 1928 painting by Rivera of Oaxacan  dancers in orchidaceous gowns; and, from the same year, a scene, in Rivera\'92s volumetric, smooth-brushed, Paris-trained style, of women harvesting cactus by the American artist Everett Gee Jackson.\
Jackson (1900-1995), who was born in Texas and trained at the Art Institute of Chicago, made an art jaunt to Mexico in 1923 and stayed four years. He saw Rivera\'92s mural work in Mexico City and created his own variation on what had already become a local \'93national\'94 style. There he also met Anita Brenner, a Mexican writer of Latvian Jewish descent, who was the fulcrum of a lively international community, and whose widely read 1929 book \'93Idols Behind Altars\'94 \'97 there\'92s a copy on display \'97 introduced North Americans to the history of Mexican culture, from pre-Columbian times forward.\
Turn a corner into the next gallery and you find work from around the same time but on overtly polemical themes. It was important for a nation that identified itself with populist struggle to keep the memory of that struggle burning, and art was on the job. You see this in a large charcoal painting study by Rivera of the firebrand revolutionary Emiliano Zapata trampling an enemy underfoot. And in an inky Siqueiros portrait of the same leader, looking as blank-eyed as a corpse. And in a spiky, depressed Orozco painting of the peasant guerrillas known as Zapatistas, their figures as stiff as the machetes they carry, locked in a grim forced march.\uc0\u8232 By the time these pictures were made in 1931, two of the artists were working primarily in the United States; the third would arrive the next year. There were reasons for this northern influx of \'e9migr\'e9 talent. With a change of leaders in Mexico, mural commissions had dropped off, and far-left politics \'97 Rivera and Siqueiros self-identified as Communists \'97 had become less welcome. Something like the opposite was true in the United States, where young artists radicalized by the Depression were eager to explore the possibilities of social consciousness-raising public art. To work with these masters was a dream come true.\
Orozco came first, to New York in 1927. There he taught easel painting and printmaking to a rapt cohort of local artists before moving on to California to execute a mural commission for Pomona College in Claremont \'97 a 1930 fresco called \'93Prometheus\'94 that the teenage Jackson Pollock, then living in Los Angeles, saw and never forgot.\uc0\u8232 Obviously, the impossibility of having actual fresco projects in an exhibition that puts their existence at its center is a problem. But the show\'92s originating curator, Barbara Haskell \'97 joined by Marcela Guerrero, Sarah Humphreville and Alana Hernandez \'97 has finessed the matter by surrounding photographic reproductions of monumental works with real, related paintings and drawings.\
Some are studies done for the featured fresco, as in a tempera-on-canvas Orozco sketch of his Prometheus figure. Others are exceptional distillations of the artist\'92s spirit and style. Of the three marquee Mexican muralists, Orozco was the least politically hard-line, the most pessimistic by temperament, and the most poetic-minded. And it is two stand-alone images \'97 one of a flaming, air-walking Blakean nude; the other, on loan from the Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil in Mexico City, of a furious Jesus hacking his cross to bits \'97 that make the deepest impression here.\
Most valuably, though, the curators have also included work by young American artists inspired by Orozco\'92s example. Pollock is one. Several livid, snarly, body-based paintings from the late 1930s show how thoroughly \'93Prometheus\'94 had gotten under his skin. And the influence seems to have passed, by art world osmosis \'97 many artists were networked through working on W.P.A. mural projects at the time \'97 to artists like the Chicago-based Charles White, who applied a version of Orozco\'92s brand of muscular expressionism to his own epical paintings of African-American life.\
From this point on in the exhibition, although the Mexican muralists continue to be the anchor, American art crowds the spotlight. Rivera, as befits his celebrity, is awarded two separate spaces. But works by artists who learned from him \'97 Ben Shahn, Philip Evergood, Thelma Johnson Streat, Xavier Gonzalez and Marion Greenwood \'97 outnumber his own. You can see why he was a popular model. There\'92s something expressively boilerplate about his art, making it adaptable to varied uses and settings and patronage. This was one reason that, as the 1930s went on, more ideologically committed artists like Siqueiros began to brand him a sellout.\
Siqueiros was the true on-the-ground activist of the three \'97 he participated in a plot to assassinate Trotsky \'97 and the one who took the most radical formal chances in his art. He is also given two galleries. The first is ostensibly devoted to his 1932 stay in Los Angeles and a mural he painted there, \'93Tropical America: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos\'94 \'97 or \'93Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism.\'94 But the people who commissioned it seem to have expected work on a different, upbeat theme and, offended by the scathing take on Yankee aggression, whited out the painting. (Chicano artists and activists lobbied for years to repair it, with the city and the Getty Conservation Institute teaming up to cover the cost, though as a gallery label notes, the brightness of its original colors proved to be unrecoverable. It appears in the show in a black-and-white photograph of its original state.)\
What this gallery is really about, though, is the stellar young artists who assisted and emulated him, among them Philip Guston (a high school friend of Pollock) and the Japanese-American painter Eitaro Ishigaki, whose racial identity and immigrant status marginalized him as surely as they did black and Latino artists at the time. (In 1951, he was arrested by the F.B.I. for having Communist affiliations and deported to Japan.)\uc0\u8232 The exhibition\'92s final gallery, \'93Siqueiros and the Experimental Workshop,\'94 is basically a Siqueiros-Pollock showcase. It\'92s set in New York, where, beginning in 1936, the two artists worked together as teacher and student. We see examples of the increasingly anti-conventional techniques the muralist developed: spraying, splattered, dripping paint, building up glazes in ugly lumps on the canvas surface, anything to make the results look unpolished and unsettling. And we see Pollock beginning to test out these unorthodoxies. He would, eventually, transcendently, apply them to abstraction. But it\'92s clear that even in the 1930s he was on fire. And the evidence is that Siqueiros held the igniting match.\
Is it too much to say that we owe Abstract Expressionism, at least the Pollock version of it, to Mexico? Maybe, but only a little too much. In any case, the debt was forgotten fast. Pollock stayed mum on the subject of sources. Once World War II started, the United States didn\'92t want to know from anticapitalist leftists, or immigrants, particularly brown-skinned ones. After the war, Communist was a prosecutorial scare-word, and Abstract Expressionism was suddenly red-white-and-blue. It was advertised internationally as a visual embodiment of American freedom, with no mention, maybe no memory, of where its greatest practitioner learned his Ab-Ex moves.\
This exhibition demonstrates this by putting Siqueiros and Pollock together and uses the same compare and contrast method throughout, often pairing canonical stars with artists we may not know, like Luis Arenal, Jes\'fas Escobedo, Mardonio Maga\'f1a, Edward Millman, Alfredo Ramos Martinez, Mitchell Siporin, Henrietta Shore, and Thelma Johnson Streat. Did influence run both ways? Student to teacher? South to north and back? Undoubtedly. (And everyone learned from Europe.) The result at the Whitney is a study in multidirectional flow, tides meeting, mingling, which is the basic dynamic of art history, as it is, or should be, of American life. It\'92s a dynamic of generosity. It gives the show warmth and grandeur. Why on earth would we want to stop the flow now?\uc0\u8232 \u8232

\b0 by FRED R.CONRAD   5 March 2018\uc0\u8232 Bioraphy not found\
Jacob Lawrence painted \'93The Migration of the Negro,\'94 60 small pictures in tempera on hardboard panels, at 33 West 125th Street in Harlem in 1941. Lawrence was 24. "With its visual tact and deep emotion, it was instantly recognized as a tour de force, a new American epic," says Holland Cotter. "It made his career."\uc0\u8232 The series is about the shift of African-American populations from a poor and repressive rural South to a prosperous but unwelcoming urban North between the two world wars. Lawrence\'92s family participated in that shift. For him it was lived history, an organic phenomenon, and he conceived his depiction of it that way. But two concurrent exhibitions \'97 one at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the other at Triple Candie, a nonprofit space in Harlem \'97 suggest that his concept has not come down to us intact.\u8232 Lawrence painted the 60 pictures not one at a time but production-line style, working on them all simultaneously. In a given studio session he would apply a single color to several paintings in progress. In the next session he would apply another color in the same way. Chromatic recurrence was one way he bound the series together. \
The use of repeated motifs was another. Linear uprights \'97 bare trees, prison bars, raised arms, flames \'97 alternate with the flat planes of open skies or high walls to create a rhythm of escapes and enclosures punctuated by exclamations. Figures, often in silhouette, move, then wait, then move again. Descriptive captions under each image enhance a sense of unity. The series begins with these words: "During the World War there was a great migration North by Southern Negroes." It ends, "And the migrants kept coming."\uc0\u8232 "For Lawrence the series was a single work, and he wanted it exhibited as such. But from the start his wishes were ignored more often than not. In 1942 the Museum of Modern Art bought half the series: all the even-numbered pictures. The Phillips Gallery in Washington bought the others. Lawrence hoped that both institutions would cooperate in showing the two parts together, which they have. But an integrated work had been irrevocably broken, and the breaking continues." \u8232 "But the show at the Whitney Museum represents a mere fragment of the Phillips Collection\'92s larger fragment. The overarching drama of the series, the cumulative product of Lawrence\'92s thought-through formal calculation and narrative subtlety, is, if not lost, much diminished. And such editing has spurred a second exhibition, 'Undoing the Ongoing Bastardization of 'The Migration of the Negro' by Jacob Lawrence,' at Triple Candie."\u8232 "One of the virtues of the piece is that its parts are strong enough to stand on their own. From the opening patchwork image of crowds in a Southern railroad station pushing their way through gates marked 'Chicago,' 'New York' and 'St. Louis'; to one of Northern tenement buildings turned into modernist geometric abstractions; to a third image of the same buildings being bombed \'97 the explosions shoot up like bloodied shaving brushes \'97 during an incident of racial violence."\u8232 "There are two good reasons to visit the Triple Candie show: It presents the complete 'Migration of the Negro' series, or a version of it; and it shows it in the Harlem neighborhood where Lawrence created it, a neighborhood that became predominantly African-American as a direct result of that migration. I was just as moved to see the series in reproduction there as I was to see it complete in its original form at the Whitney six years ago, if for different reasons."\u8232 "What's more real, after all, art or the feeling of it? History or the telling of it? Medium or message? We know the conventional market wisdom. It's important to have the alternative."\u8232 \

\b0 by ELIZABETH MANCHESTER  Feb 2000\uc0\u8232 As Lipman Writer in Residence she is researching and writing about innovative contemporary art made using clay.\u8232 Her own practice is currently exploring the potential of clay to receive the imprint of a gesture and what status the resulting object might have; it engages with Marcel Duchamp\'92s notion of the infrathin in relation to the imprint and positive and negative casting, examined particularly through looking at Etant donn\'e9s and the erotic objects. \
\uc0\u8232 Kentridge makes short animation films from large-scale drawings in charcoal and pastel on paper. Each drawing, which contains a single scene, is successively altered through erasing and redrawing and photographed in 16 or 35mm film at each stage of its evolution. Remnants of successive stages remain on the paper, and provide a metaphor for the layering of memory which is one of Kentridge's principal themes. The films in this series, titled Drawings for Projection (see Tate T07482-5 and T07480-81), are set in the devastated landscape south of Johannesburg where derelict mines and factories, mine dumps and slime dams have created a terrain of nostalgia and loss. Kentridge's repeated erasure and redrawing, which leave marks without completely transforming the image, together with the jerky movement of the animation, operate in parallel with his depiction of human processes, both physical and political, enacted on the landscape. \
Felix in Exile is Kentridge's fifth film. It was made from forty drawings and is accompanied by music by Phillip Miller and Motsumi Makhene. It introduces a new character to the series: Nandi, an African woman, who appears at the beginning of the film making drawings of the landscape. She observes the land with surveyor's instruments, watching African bodies, with bleeding wounds, which melt into the landscape. She is recording the evidence of violence and massacre that is part of South Africa's recent history. Felix Teitelbaum, who features in Kentridge's first and fourth films as the humane and loving alter-ego to the ruthless capitalist white South African psyche, appears here semi-naked and alone in a foreign hotel room, brooding over Nandi's drawings of the damaged African landscape, which cover his suitcase and walls. Felix looks at himself in the mirror while shaving and Nandi appears to him. They are connected to one another, through the mirror, by a double-ended telescope and embrace, but Nandi is later shot and absorbed back into the ground like the bodies she was observing earlier. A flood of blue water in the hotel room, brought about by the process of painful remembering, symbolises tears of grief and loss and the Biblical flood which promises new life. Kentridge has commented: 'Felix in Exile was made at the time just before the first general election in South Africa, and questioned the way in which the people who had died on the journey to this new dispensation would be remembered' (William Kentridge 1998, p.90). In this film Nandi's drawing could be read as an attempt to construct a new national identity through the preservation, rather than erasure, of brutal and racist colonial memory. \uc0\u8232 \

\b0 by KRISTEN M.JONE\uc0\u8232 based in Berkeley, California, founder and Creative Consultant of Wabisabi LCC. She studied at Maryland Institute College of Art. She worked for different years for Frieze magazine.\u8232 \u8232 It\'92s commonplace to note when exhibitions offer a timely opportunity to reconsider an artist\'92s work, but in Ana Mendieta\'92s case such observations are as disturbing as they are apt. \'91Ana Mendieta: Earth Body, Sculpture and Performance, 1972\'961985\'92 follows a smattering of shows and thoughtful critical re-examinations that have cropped up in recent years, and it should contribute greatly toward fostering an appreciation of Mendieta\'92s elusive yet rigorous projects. Not least important, it is accompanied by a substantial catalogue featuring incisive essays by Olga M. Viso, Chrissie Iles, Julia P. Herzberg and Guy Brett. But the prevailing misinterpretation, marginalization or outright dismissal of Mendieta\'92s work since her premature death in 1985 have a particular sting. This re-evaluation is long overdue \'96 and much deserved.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl276\slmult1\sa200\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The show opens with striking photographic images that document early performances in which Mendieta enacted dramatic bodily transformations \'96 applying thick make-up, donning wigs, covering her face with a torn stocking \'96 whose similarity to later works by Cindy Sherman has been noted by more than one critic. Other photographs capture tough performances incorporating blood, which responded to Viennese Actionism as well as feminist concerns. The show pays special attention to these and other works Mendieta created during her decade-long stint at the University of Iowa, where she enthusiastically participated in Hans Breder\'92s ground-breaking Intermedia programme. Breder (who was Mendieta\'92s lover and occasional artistic collaborator before her marriage to Carl Andre) promoted an interdisciplinary, process-oriented approach to art-making, and brought an array of artists involved with Conceptual and Performance art to visit, including Scott Burton and Vito Acconci.\
Equally important for Mendieta were trips she began to take to Mexico, which fed her growing fascination with pre-Columbian iconography. In Mexico she also made the first of her \'91Siluetas\'92 (1973\'9680), richly developed, eerily symbolic works in which she cut, burnt, drew or otherwise shaped a human silhouette (usually her own) into an array of outdoor sites. In Cuba, the homeland from which she had been exiled at the age of 12 and to which she often longed to return, she produced her \'91Rupestrian Sculptures\'92 (1981), carving anthropomorphic shapes into ancient limestone grottoes. Questioning the tendency of much Earth art to dominate the landscape, she used the term \'91Earth Body\'92 to describe her ephemeral interventions. The stark beauty of the \'91Siluetas\'92 (all the more potent for being incidental) is hard to overstate \'96 in photographs and films red and white flowers glow against sand, water, or greenery; flames, sometimes tinted by the artist, burn against sky and earth.\
Mendieta drew heavily on research about indigenous beliefs, including Santer\'eda deities. Fearing essentialist readings, she eventually attempted to distance her work from association with feminist goddess cults, but biases were hard to shake. Sculptures and drawings Mendieta produced during the early 1980s are haunting but uncharacteristically static. On the other hand, the Super-8 films with which she carefully documented her actions form the show\'92s radiant heart. Iles notes in the catalogue that \'91just as Mendieta constructed each action and sculpture as a private act of meditation and dedication, she filmed each one in a way that allows it to be re-experienced.\'92 Camera angles, distance, framing and colour contribute to their tense poetry. Shot from multiple vantage points in the film Untitled (Flower Person) (1975), a white peony figure floats down a creek on a bier then breaks apart, evoking the dying Ophelia. The spine-tingling footage of Anima, Silueta de Cohetes (Soul, Silhouette of Fireworks, 1976) shows the artist\'92s wicker effigy exploding with fireworks at night-time.\
\uc0\u8232 Mendieta produced nearly 80 of these films, making her, as Iles points out, the most prolific artist-\'96filmmaker of the period. The tendency to overemphasize aspects of Mendieta\'92s personal biography, especially her gender and tragic death, calls to mind similar problems with the critical reception of Eva Hesse\'92s work. (In contrast, Robert Smithson\'92s reputation was only enhanced by his early demise, which was perceived as unconnected to his artistic production rather than somehow inevitable.) But this Cuban \'e9migr\'e9e knew that she faced multiple challenges in presenting her radically inventive work. A decade ago Luis Camnitzer wrote perceptively in his book New Art of Cuba of the rift between Mendieta\'92s art and the contemporary American mainstream caused by the dual preoccupation with her work as \'91ethnic and feminist\'92. He wrote: \'91The fact of her double separateness, along with the artificiality of the quota system, created a static that tended to interfere with a direct relationship to her work by the audience.\'92 Camnitzer went on to quote derogatory remarks made by certain critics after Mendieta\'92s death and to note that, even in 1994, the time was not ripe for adequate appreciation of her work. One hopes that time has finally arrived.\u8232 \

I think I might be obsessed with kusozu, Japanese watercolor paintings that graphically depict human decomposition, which were popular between the 13th and 19th centuries; Body of a Courtesan in Nine Stages is another series in this genre featured previously on this site.  Kusozu works of art were inspired by Buddhist beliefs and these paintings were meant to encourage people to ponder the temporary nature of the physical world.  Kusozu watercolors also happen to be fantastic early studies of human decay and taphonomy, which is why one series, titled Kusozu: the death of a noble lady and the decay of her body, is currently on display as part of the Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime exhibit in London.\

The below scenes include: (1) the woman\'92s impending death and her preparation for it;  the noble woman has just passed away and her loved ones are seated around her; (3) slight skin discoloration (maybe some liver mortis) and a bit of bloating of during early decomposition; (4) the onset of putrefaction with bloating and marbling; (5) advanced decomposition as seen by pervasive marbling, leakage of purge fluid from the mouth, and the abdominal cavity has burst open (6) caving of abdominal cavity and scavenging animals; (7) start of skeletonization and the disappearance of soft tissue; (8) complete skeletonization and scattering of remains; (9) finally human remains have been completely scattered or consumed by unseen animals so all that remains is a memorial for the deceased woman. \uc0\u8232 \

\cf0 \uc0\u8232 \u8232 How did a young graffiti rebel go from selling drawings for $50 in 1980 to having a painting come up for auction this week at a staggering $60 million?\
[ Update: The painting sold for $110.5 million at auction ]\
The answer to this remarkable trajectory of Jean-Michel Basquiat, who died at 27 of a drug overdose in 1988, lies in the art market\'92s unpredictable but powerful alchemy: a combination of raw talent, compelling biography and limited supply.\
\'93And then, on top of that, the cool factor and the mythology,\'94 said Franklin Sirmans, the director of the P\'e9rez Art Museum Miami, an expert on Basquiat. \'93It\'92s a great success story that also comes along with a lot of the tragedy people can relate to and what we look to see in our artists \'97 our Kurt Cobains and our Janis Joplins.\'94\
On Thursday night, Sotheby\'92s will offer Basquiat\'92s 1982 painting of a face in the shape of a skull, \'93Untitled,\'94 with a guaranteed price of at least $60 million, an auction high for the artist. And given the current international appetite for his work, that figure could go higher in a bidding war.\uc0\u8232 Such eight-figure sums are a stunning jump in value for a piece that sold for just $19,000 in 1984 to two collectors of emerging artists, Jerry and Emily Spiegel. The work hasn\'92t been on the market since.\
High prices are hardly new for Basquiat, art experts note. Last year, he became the highest-grossing American artist at auction, generating $171.5 million from 80 works, according to the Artprice database. The auction high for Basquiat has increased at least tenfold in the last 15 years, soaring to $57.3 million in 2016 with Christie\'92s spring sale of a 1982 \'93Untitled\'94 Basquiat owned by the New York collector Adam Lindemann, in which the artist depicts himself as a horned devil amid orange, red, white and black brush strokes.\
\'93As the market was accelerating, you had distinguished connoisseurs of modern art who had no hesitation about putting Basquiat beside Picasso,\'94 said the dealer Jeffrey Deitch, who gave the eulogy at the artist\'92s funeral. \'93Already he was in a different league than almost any other contemporary artist.\'94\
The question is whether price levels will remain this high. Typically, people in the auction world say, a surge in prices prompts collectors to jump on the bandwagon, consigning their works by the same artist. Indeed, after Christie\'92s success with its Basquiat last spring, it seemed as though everyone wanted in on the action.\uc0\u8232 There are no fewer than 16 Basquiats on offer at Sotheby\'92s, Christie\'92s and Phillips\'92s evening auctions this season, which together represent an estimated minimum value of about $119 million \'97 out of a total of $690 million for the three sales. Basquiat is, both numerically and financially, the week\'92s heavyweight artist.\u8232 But most of the Basquiat works to come to auction in the near future are likely to be of lesser importance, auction experts say, which may or may not benefit from the latest Basquiat price. \'93There will be a large number of people wanting to sell \'97 and most of what they want to sell will be inferior,\'94 said Brett Gorvy, Christie\'92s former chairman and international head of postwar and contemporary art, who this year became a dealer. \'93You can have a big high and then weaker paintings will pull down the market to a more sane level.\'94\
When it comes to the best of Basquiat, however \'97 generally, works produced between 1981 and 1983 at the start of his short career (though there are also good later pieces) \'97 the demand remains high. Collectors who own top Basquiats don\'92t want to sell, and museums can\'92t afford them, so few of his paintings are in major institutions.\
\'93It\'92s a bit like the Warhol Marilyns,\'94 Mr. Gorvy said. \'93Something huge would have to happen for those to come to market.\'94 And few other artists, he added, \'93are creating that sort of buzz in the marketplace.\'94\uc0\u8232 Though Basquiat might be the darling of the market and have a grass-roots popularity, there has been a paucity of big retrospectives in major international museums like the Tate Modern in London or the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A large show, \'93Basquiat: Boom for Real,\'94 opening at the Barbican Center in London on Sept. 21, will be the first large-scale British exhibition of his work.\
The $60 million painting at Sotheby\'92s on Thursday, the most highly valued of New York\'92s May auction season, has been consigned by Lise Spiegel Wilks, the daughter of Mr. Spiegel, a real estate developer and art collector of Kings Point, N.Y., and his wife Emily. The elder Spiegels both died in 2009, leaving their collection to their daughters, Ms. Wilks and Pamela Sanders. Ms. Sanders has consigned 107 works from her parents\'92 collection at Christie\'92s, for a guarantee of  more than $100 million, according to Bloomberg \'97 but none of those works are at the value of her sister\'92s inherited \'93Untitled.\'94\uc0\u8232 \'93It\'92s a showstopper,\'94 the Paris dealer Christian Ogier said of the painting. \'93Basquiat is always good, but here he is at his strongest in color and edginess.\'94\
People are also drawn to Basquiat\'92s personal story: a young black man in dreadlocks from Brooklyn who died just seven years into an exploding career.\
Then, too, there was Mr. Basquiat\'92s artistic talent and historical significance. \'93He is one of the great artists of the second half of the 20th century,\'94 said Dieter Buchhart, a curator based in Vienna and New York who has organized Basquiat exhibitions around the world. \'93The way he worked with words, the line and how he soaked up all the information surrounding him.\'94\
The collectors Herb and Lenore Schorr were among Basquiat\'92s earliest supporters. In 1981, they bought the artist\'92s eight-foot-wide painting \'93Poison Oasis\'94 from the New York dealer Annina Nosei for $3,500. Just two years later, they purchased another painting for $10,000 at the Fun Gallery\'92s one-man Basquiat show in New York.\
\'93He had the natural skills of drawing and painting, he used words, and he represented New York, which appealed to us,\'94 Mrs. Schorr, 75, recalled. \'93He was a very brilliant, charismatic young man.\'94 Artists\'92 flames have died out in the past. The question is whether this one will continue to burn.\
\'93The dimensions of Basquiat are more apparent in the world today \'97 his impact on music, lyrics, dress \'97 even hair \'97 is totally integrated and embedded in our culture,\'94 said Larry Warsh, a longtime Basquiat collector. \'93Jean-Michel is now connected to the greats of art history. So what do you pay for that?\'94\uc0\u8232 \u8232

\b0 by KATHLEEN KUIPER\uc0\u8232 was Senior Editor, Arts & Culture, Encyclop\'e6dia Britannica until 2016. She also edited Merriam-Webster\'92s Encyclopedia of Literature.\u8232 \u8232 \kerning1\expnd1\expndtw8
Hi\'ebronymus Bosch, also spelled Jheronimus Bos, pseudonym of Jeroen van Aiken, Aeken also spelled Aquen or Aken, also called Jeroen Anthoniszoon, (born c. 1450, \'92s-Hertogenbosch, Brabant [now in the Netherlands]\'97buried August 9, 1516, \'92s-Hertogenbosch), brilliant and original northern European painter whose work reveals an unusual iconography of a complex and individual style. He was recognized as a highly imaginative \'93creator of devils\'94 and a powerful inventor of seeming nonsense full of satirical and moralizing meaning.\
\
Works attributed to his youthful period show an awkwardness in drawing and composition and brushwork somewhat limited in its scope. Such paintings as The Cure of Folly, Crucifixion, The Adoration of the Magi, The Seven Deadly Sins, The Marriage at Cana, Ecce Homo, and The Conjurer are representative of that period. The presence of certain motifs, expanded in the more-sophisticated works of the artist\'92s middle period, and a limited technique, unsure yet bold, provide a beginning from which to view Bosch\'92s artistic origins. Between the first painting in that early group, The Cure of Folly, and the last, The Conjurer, a steady development can be seen. The iconography of the latter is more complex, and the characteristic themes that received their fullest expression in the great masterpieces of his late period have begun to emerge.\
\
In those early paintings Bosch had begun to depict humanity\'92s vulnerability to the temptation of evil, the deceptive allure of sin, and the obsessive attraction of lust, heresy, and obscenity. In calm and prosaic settings, groups of people exemplify the credulity, ignorance, and absurdities of the human race. However, the imagery of the early works is still relatively conventional, with only an occasional intrusion of the bizarre in the form of a lurking demon or a strangely dressed magician.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw3
To Bosch\'92s fruitful middle period belong the great panoramic triptychs such as the Haywain, The Temptation of St. Anthony, and The Garden of Earthly Delights. His figures are graceful and his colours subtle and sure, and all is in motion in those ambitious and extremely complex works. The paintings are marked by an eruption of fantasy, expressed in monstrous apocalyptic scenes of chaos and nightmare that are contrasted and juxtaposed with idyllic portrayals of humankind in the age of innocence. During this period Bosch elaborated on his early ideas, and the few paintings that survive establish the evolution of his thought. Bosch\'92s disconcerting mixture of fantasy and reality is further developed in the Haywain, the outside wings, or cover panels, of which recall the scenes of The Seven Deadly Sins. The cursive style that he worked out for the triptych resembles that of watercolour. In the central panel, a rendition of the Flemish proverb \'93The world is a haystack from which each takes what he can,\'94 Bosch shows the trickery of the demon who guides the procession of people from the earthly paradise depicted on the left wing to the horrors of hell shown on the right one.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \kerning1\expnd1\expndtw8
\
Bosch\'92s The Temptation of St. Anthony displays his ascent to stylistic maturity. The brushstrokes are sharper and terser, with much more command than before. The composition becomes more fluid, and space is regulated by the incidents and creatures that the viewer\'92s attention is focused on. His mastery of fine brush-point calligraphy, permitting subtle nuances of contour and movement, is fully evident. Bosch portrays the human struggle against temptation, as well as the omnipresence of the Devil, in his St. Anthony, one of the best keys to the artist\'92s personal iconography. The hermit saint in this work is cast as the heroic symbol of humankind. In the central panel St. Anthony is beset by an array of grotesque demons, their horrible bodies being brilliantly visualized amalgamations of human, animal, vegetable, and inanimate parts. In the background is a hellish, fantastically bizarre landscape painted with the most exquisite detail. Bosch\'92s development of the theme of the charlatan deceiving humans and taking away their salvation receives its fullest exposition in St. Anthony, with its condemnation of heresy and the seductions of false doctrines.\
\
The Garden of Earthly Delights, representative of Bosch at his mature best, shows the earthly paradise with the creation of woman, the first temptation, and the Fall. The painting\'92s beautiful and unsettling images of sensuality and of the dreams that afflict the people who live in a pleasure-seeking world express Bosch\'92s iconographic originality with tremendous force. The chief characteristic of this work is perhaps its dreamlike quality; multitudes of nude human figures, giant birds, and horses cavort and frolic in a delightfully implausible, otherworldly landscape, and all the elements come together to produce a perfect, harmonious whole.\
\
Bosch\'92s late works are fundamentally different. The scale changes radically, and, instead of meadows or hellish landscapes inhabited by hundreds of tiny beings, he painted densely compacted groups of half-length figures pressed tight against the picture plane. In those dramatic close-ups, of which The Crowning with Thorns and Christ Carrying the Cross are representative, the event is portrayed so near that the spectator seems to participate in it physically as well as psychologically. The most peaceful and untroubled of Bosch\'92s mature works depict various saints in contemplation or repose. Among those works are St. John the Evangelist on Patmos and St. Jerome in Prayer.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa200\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Bosch\'92s preoccupation in much of his work with the evils of the world did not preclude his vision of a world full of beauty. His adeptness at handling colour harmonies and at creating deeply felt works of the imagination is readily apparent. Though a spate of imitators tried to appropriate his visual style, its uniqueness prevented his having any real followers.

\i0 The Garden of Earthly Delights is the modern title given to a triptych oil painting on oak panel painted by the Early Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch, between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between 40 and 60 years old. It has been housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since the year 1939. \
As so little is known of Bosch's life or intentions, interpretations of his intent have ranged from an admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence, to a dire warning on the perils of life's temptations, to an evocation of ultimate sexual joy. The intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, has led to a wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries. Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost. \

The other existing portions of the triptych are The Ship of Fools and Allegory of Gluttony and Lust, while The Wayfarer was painted on the external right panel. \
Death and the Miser belongs to the tradition of the memento mori, works that remind the viewer of the inevitability of death. The painting shows the influence of popular 15th-century handbooks on the art of dying (Ars moriendi), intended to help Christians choose Christ over sinful pleasures.  \

When King Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German kaiser in 1871, Berlin became a center of political power. With its three million inhabitants, the metropolis on the Spree became an economic, civic, and, in particular, social and cultural hub. At the turn of the century, Berlin possessed an expressly international flair, even if restrictive Wilhelmian policies repeatedly checked modern developments and avant-garde movements. But this had little effect on the fascination that the city held. Visitors, both German and foreign, strolled along the elegant Unter den Linden, past spectacularly ostentatious architecture and tributes in stone to the Hohenzollern rulers. They visited the well-stocked department stores, the opulent opera houses, the magnificent revue palaces, and Max Reinhardt\'92s celebrated theaters, sampling the various worlds that Berlin nurtured in the Gr\'fcnderjahre, the years of expansion in the early 1870s when it basked in the light of its newfound importance. \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \kerning1\expnd1\expndtw8
\
The policies established in the Berlin of the monarchy, the \'93fastest-moving city in the world,\'94 were to set the course the German Reich was to follow in the years to come. Kaiser Wilhelm II, known for his comic opera costumes and his exaggerated rhetoric, came up with the catchphrase, embraced by the aristocracy as well as the bourgeoisie, that Germany, too, needed a \'93place in the sun.\'94 The quest for colonies that followed, enthusiastically supported by a complacent Reichstag, was to find its premature end in the years of the First World War. \
\
In turn-of-the-century Berlin, the economy flourished. The city was in the grip of a near euphoric period of development, and a large number of ambitious enterprises were established during the building boom. And sharing in the general optimism was Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl, trained as a master fitter. \
\
Born in Berlin on October 30, 1878, as the son of the journeyman locksmith Gustav Hermann Theodor Riefenstahl and his wife, Amalie, Alfred Riefenstahl grew up with two brothers and a sister. He abandoned the artisan milieu of his forefathers to become a salesman and make his way on his own. Shortly after receiving his master\'92s certificate, he took over a prosperous installation business, which he ran with a combination of practical knowledge and commercial farsightedness. His daughter Leni later portrayed him as a large and powerful man with blond hair and blue eyes. Contemporary photographs reveal a well-dressed figure mindful of his appearance, who commanded respect and appeared proud of the social standing he had achieved on his own. Alfred Riefenstahl had a strong character, and insisted on staying in control and exerting his authority. He was full of life, temperamental, and inclined to violent outbursts if anyone stood in his way, whether in business or private. He seldom tolerated argument. \
\
He married Bertha Ida Scherlach, born to German parents in Wl/o-cll/awek, Poland, on October 9, 1880. Her father, Karl Ludwig Ferdinand Scherlach, a carpenter from West Prussia (in Memoiren, Riefenstahl promoted him to an "architect"), had found work in neighboring Poland and settled there. Together, he and his East Prussian wife, Ottilie, had eighteen children. Ottilie died giving birth to their eighteenth child, Bertha, and the thirty-eight-year-old widower suddenly found himself alone with his offspring. Shortly after the death of his wife, he married a woman who had been a governess in the Scherlach household and who would bear him three more children in the years that followed. \
\
When Scherlach made the decision to move with his family to Berlin, he was too old to seek new employment. So it was the children, including Bertha, who supported the family. Bertha had completed her training as a seamstress and, as the youngest offspring of a large family well accustomed to working from a young age, quickly found a position in the country's capital. Even with her own earnings she was forced to lead a very modest life, as she had to support her out-of-work father and her young siblings. \
\
When the respectable businessman Alfred Riefenstahl entered her life, her rise in society was assured. But with her wedding she had to bury the secret dream of her youth of becoming an actress. Bertha Scherlach met Alfred Riefenstahl, two years her senior, at a costume ball in 1900. It was not a long courtship; the two quickly realized they would stay together-not least because Bertha soon was expecting her first child. The wedding took place in Berlin on April 5, 1902. \
\
The relationship between Alfred and Bertha Riefenstahl was a difficult one, but typical for the times. On one side was a husband who demanded total authority, and on the other a woman who was not only unprepared but also probably unable to challenge him. The rules of Wilhelmian society dictated that she subordinate herself to her husband's wishes, and the two adjusted to a petit-bourgeois life, in which the young family soon was firmly rooted. \
\
The birth of Bertha Helene Amalie Riefenstahl was recorded at the Berlin Registry Office XIII on August 22, 1902. As was customary at the time, the birth took place at home, in a simple, modest apartment on Prinz-Eugen-Strasse in the working-class quarter of Wedding. From infancy on, she was called "Leni." \
\
\
Leni Riefenstahl led a protected childhood, free of material cares. The family slowly worked its way up from a petit-bourgeois milieu to the middle class. Alfred Riefenstahl quickly prospered in the heating and ventilation systems firm that he opened on Kurf\'fcrstenstrasse, but this prosperity was based more on luck than on business acumen. His business expanded owing to the installation contracts resulting from the city's countless new construction projects and the renovation of older buildings. These increased the family's earnings and guaranteed a certain standard of living. \
\
As he did from his wife, Alfred Riefenstahl expected discipline and absolute obedience from his daughter. He had been raised to rule his family with a firm hand and tolerate no disagreement, and he considered the example set by his father to be the ideal for his own family. He was as uncompromising at home as he was in business, routinely imposing his own habits on his wife and his child, which led to constant conflict. Riefenstahl flew into a rage at the least disturbance of his daily routine and could "stamp like an elephant if the button on his starched collar proved hard to undo." \
\
Leni secretly wished for a gentle, loving father, but when she attempted to break away from his cold and severe control, rebelling against her predetermined role as the obedient daughter, he reacted with outbursts of rage. Nor did he shrink from beating and humiliating his daughter and locking her in the house for the slightest infraction, or from punishing her with a silence that would last for weeks. "Once, when I was caught [stealing apples] and my father found out about it, he gave me a terrible whipping and locked me in a dark room for an entire day. And I suffered his sternness on other occasions as well." The girl suffered from her father's coldness and spent her whole childhood trying to wrest from him some proof of his love, but again and again she encountered only harsh rejection or emotional distance. \
\
And yet her father quickly registered that Leni had inherited his own stubbornness and, as she grew older, was prepared to battle her father's authority. More and more often she made decisions without first asking her father's permission, which she tried to keep secret. For example, she kept from him the fact that she had registered at a gymnastics club and, later, at dancing school. The volatile relationship between father and daughter was always threatening to explode, and the most innocuous event could turn into a contest of wills: "It was often difficult to get along with him. He liked to play chess with me-but I always had to let him win. Once, when I beat him, he became so mad that he forbade me to go to a costume party I was so looking forward to." \
\
As mother and wife, Bertha Riefenstahl often found herself caught between two fronts in the arguments between her daughter and her husband. Though emotionally she usually sided with her daughter, she dared not go against her husband. As a rule, she tried to mediate between them, at the risk of finding herself trapped in the minefield of family quarrels as soon as she took one side or the other. \
\
Nor did the birth in 1905 of a second child, named Heinz-the son Alfred Riefenstahl had so wished for-improve the atmosphere at home. Things relaxed only when the father was out of the house on business or enjoying himself with his friends. \'93Luckily, my father often went hunting, and only when he was gone could we all finally feel free at home.\'94 \
\
Leni, Heinz, and their mother established something resembling a secret society. When Riefenstahl was away, they all were happy to go about their activities without reservation, activities he didn\'92t approve of or simply forbade. Leni quickly developed a very affectionate relationship with her brother, who was three years younger. For the whole of her life she felt closely connected to him, though with his essentially reticent and shy personality he was totally different from his quick-witted and audacious sister. \
\
From the outside, the Riefenstahls epitomized a happy family. No one was privy to the tensions that went on behind the scenes in an effort to appear a promising young middle-class family. A photo from the period shows the two children in their Sunday sailor suits, a symbol at the time not only of pride in the kaiser\'92s navy but also of belonging to \'93better society.\'94 \
Alfred Riefenstahl\'92s flourishing businesses required that the family demonstrate a certain standard of living. Leni Riefenstahl\'92s childhood, therefore, was marked by frequent moves and changes of neighborhood, which always called for her to adapt to a new location. The family first moved from Wedding to Hermannplatz in Berlin- Neuk\'88lln, then to Yorckstrasse in Sch\'88neberg and on to Wilmersdorf before temporarily settling southeast of the city, in 1921, in Rauchfangswerder in the Brandenburg March. \
\
\'93In My Youth I Was a Happy Person\'94 \
Even before moving to Rauchfangswerder, located on a peninsula of the Zeuthener See, the outdoors played an important role in the Riefenstahl family\'92s life. In portraying her childhood, Leni Riefenstahl always stressed how important nature was to her. The well- to-do family soon bought a small weekend house in a little village that Riefenstahl calls Petz and which presumably is the town of P\'89tz, located on the P\'89tzer Vordersee near the small Brandenburg city of Bestensee. Fleeing the hectic pace of big-city life, the Riefenstahls spent nearly every weekend here, an hour by train from Berlin. Leni Riefenstahl, by her own account, grew into a true \'93child of nature, beneath trees and bushes, with plants and insects, watched over and protected.\'94 Being outdoors in nature was essential to her. \
\
The girl who became accustomed to life in the country from an early age welcomed the family\'92s later move to Rauchfangswerder, even though the daily hour-and-a-half trip to Berlin was time-consuming and exhausting. The idyllic country surroundings appeared more important to her than the comforts of the city. The Riefenstahls\'92 property included a large overgrown meadow that ran down to a lake bordered by old weeping willows, the branches of which dipped into the water. The family owned a rowboat and also made outings to the nearby forest and meadows. Their not always simple family life became noticeably more relaxed in this bucolic setting, and, far from his business concerns and the noise of the metropolis, even Alfred Riefenstahl, with his weekday moods and his tendency to angry outbursts, became calmer here. He would lie for hours on the shore of the lake or work in the small garden where the family grew fruits and vegetables for their table. \
\
Leni Riefenstahl tried her whole life to recapture the idyllic experience of nature that she had known as a child. Being outdoors in harmony with nature provided an important and incomparable source of strength. Particularly important to the young girl was the privacy and time for herself she found there. She played with the neighborhood children, of course, climbing trees and organizing foot- and swimming races: \'93Nothing was too high for me or too steep or too dangerous.\'94 But, at least as she presented it in retrospect, she continually withdrew to spend whole hours and days in her own dreamworld. Even in early childhood she needed to withdraw from her playmates as well as from her family from time to time, often to the little wooden hut that her father built for her as a refuge amid the huge sunflowers in the garden. There she could get away from the world and enjoy the leisure time that her parents uncritically granted her: \'93It was here that I could dream.\'94 \
\
Riefenstahl\'92s harmonious transfiguration of her past runs like a thread through all of her versions of her life. Despite the considerable burdens imposed by her hot- tempered, authoritarian father, and though she was a child and youth during the First World War and the revolutionary unrest in Berlin that followed, Riefenstahl\'92s descriptions of this time culminate in a portrait of an Eden removed from the historical moment. No passages in Memoiren address material want or the existential fears that were endemic, or one single confrontation with political events. Instead, there is the simple declaration, \'93In my youth I was a happy person.\'94 \
\
In 1908, Leni Riefenstahl was enrolled in school in Berlin-Neuk\'88lln. She impressed her teachers as an inquisitive and alert young girl who was very mature for her age. At school she could at least partially satisfy her wide-ranging thirst for knowledge. But her spontaneity and vitality did not always conform to the strict Prussian school system, which insisted on discipline and order. As a student she often was at odds with the curriculum, interrupting her teachers with countless pointed questions that went far beyond the teaching materials and earned her many a bad grade in deportment. \
\
While in school she forged a characteristic that marked her entire life: when something captured her interest, she was not satisfied until she had completely sated her quest for knowledge about the subject. Following elementary school, she attended the Kollmorgen Lyceum, a girls\'92 school from which she successfully graduated. In her favorite subjects, including gymnastics, drawing, and math, she was said to be at the top of her class. \
\
The Germany she had been born into was changing dramatically. In 1914, when she had just turned twelve, the First World War broke out in Europe, the end of which would mark the fall of the German monarchy, followed by a period of political upheaval and the declaration of the Weimar Republic. Soldiers marched out of Berlin to war with smiles on their faces, fully convinced they would be victorious. Political discussion among all levels of society in the German empire heated up; countless patriotic pamphlets were published on the war, and even the country\'92s pulpits generated militant and chauvinistic slogans. \
\
The war was soon to have an enormous effect on everyday life. By 1916, the blockade enforced by the Allies had led to serious food shortages and rationing. Many people went hungry. In the final two winters of the war, schools were no longer heated. And 1917 brought frequent strikes by Berlin\'92s workers, which affected everyone\'92s lives. \
\
The war ended in 1918 in a capitulation that Germans perceived as a humiliating national defeat. The kaiser abdicated and Germany became known as the Weimar Republic. During this period, a bloody civil war was waged in the streets of Berlin; constant protest marches by workers were met with the brutal countermeasures of the government of Friedrich Ebert. \
\
The revolution shook the foundations of German society. The streets and squares of Berlin were filled with huge numbers of uprooted men and women, and the conditions of unrest, palpable everywhere, contributed to people\'92s uncertainty. There were many who exploited this extreme disorientation, aggravating the political discontent. The notion that German troops had been \'93stabbed in the back,\'94 allegedly undefeated in the field but victims of \'93betrayal on the home front,\'94 found an ever greater audience. Inflation, which pushed many Germans of the lower classes to the brink of starvation, increased political instability in the young republic...\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \

Der Sieg des Glaubens (English: The Victory of Faith) (1933) is the first propaganda film directed by Leni Riefenstahl. Her film recounts the Fifth Party Rally of the Nazi Party, which occurred in Nuremberg from 30 August to 3 September 1933.[1] The film is of great historic interest because it shows Adolf Hitler and Ernst R\'f6hm on close and intimate terms, before R\'f6hm was shot on the orders of Hitler during the Night of the Long Knives on 1 July 1934. All known copies of the film were destroyed on Hitler's orders, and it was considered lost until a copy turned up in the 1980s in Germany.\uc0\u8232

\b0 by GRACE GLUECK   April 14 2016\uc0\u8232 was an arts reporter, critic, and art news editor for The New York Times  from the 1960s until the early 2010s.She graduated from New York University Glueck is the co-author, with Paul Gardner, of Brooklyn: People and Places, Past and Present (1991)and New York: The Painted City (1992).She has also written for The New Criterion and the Los Angeles Review of Books.\u8232 \u8232 \kerning1\expnd1\expndtw8
Biking looms large in the photographs of Danny Lyon a photo-documentarian, writer and filmmaker whose close-up-and personal shots of his fellow motorcyclists were the basis of a well-known insidery book, \'93The Bikeriders,\'94 in 1968.\
\
His work has always engaged the grittier aspects of American life, starting in the early 1960\'92s, when he followed the civil rights movement with his camera for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\
This rambling \'93re-examination\'94 of his career presents previously unpublished outtakes from some of his projects including, besides \'93The Bikeriders,\'94 a documentation of what he saw as Lower Manhattan\'92s destructive urban renewal, and an account of prisons and prisoners in Texas. The wide-ranging mix of nearly 60 vintage prints, virtually all from the 1960\'92s and some never seen before, also includes images of country people, youthful car cultists, pool players and transvestites as well as modest, low-key snapshots from his own family life and a self-portrait or two. The show starts with a glimpse of Mr. Lyon\'92s face in a rear-view mirror that is artfully twisted to a vertical position before a rainy windshield. It ends with a close-up of a pin-up image mounted on a shiny hubcap. The macho attraction to wheels and engines is saluted in other shots, like \'93Andrew Sanchez, Llanito\'94 (1975), depicting a grease-stained tinkerer intensely involved with his auto\'92s innards, and \'93Knoxville\'94 (1967), showing four high-testosterone youths congregated in and around a vintage convertible.\
\
There are poignant images of African-American life, ranging from a pair of transvestites, Roberta and Pumpkin, to a lone young girl laboring in a field in Tallahatchie County, Miss. Also in Mississippi, a close-up of hard-bitten carnival people at a county fair, and a view of ghostly abandoned farm buildings in a field of weeds project a less-than-upbeat vision of rural America.\
\
A spate of prison pictures from Texas shows men behind bars, at hard labor picking and transporting cotton and \'93relaxing\'94 under close supervision by guards. From a documentary point of view, perhaps, they are important, but they are the least interesting of the strong images in this engrossing miscellany.\

Kusama and anti-war activism \uc0\u8232 
\b0 by ANONIMOUS \uc0\u8232 \
Yayoi Kusama has always had a strong political conscience, and has been vehemently opposed to war since her teens.\
Some of her earliest surviving paintings relate to the horrors of war: Accumulation of the Corpses (Prisoner Surrounded by the Curtain of Depersonalization) and Earth of Accumulation, both dating from 1950, show bleak, war-torn landscapes where even plant life struggles to survive.\
In the 1960s, at the height of the Vietnam War, Kusama staged actions in New York, counteracting violence with activism in the form of naked body painting happenings and orgiastic love-ins. Her first Anatomic Explosion featuring naked dancers took place on 15 October 1968 opposite the New York Stock Exchange, and was prefaced by a press release that stated, \'91The money made with this stock is enabling the war to continue. We protest this cruel, greedy instrument of the war establishment.\'92\uc0\u8232 Later that year Kusama produced An Open Letter to My Hero, Richard M. Nixon in which she wrote \'91Our earth is like one little polka dot, among millions of other celestial bodies, one orb full of hatred and strife amid the peaceful, silent spheres. Let\'92s you and I change all that and make this world a new Garden of Eden\'85. You can\'92t eradicate violence by using more violence.\'92\
Later, on her return to Japan, Kusama made a series of devastating collages indicting war. War, Tidal Waves of War and Graves of the Unknown Soldiers feature harrowing images of from news magazines overlaid with watercolour and pastel. In 1995 Kusama responded to a commission from the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art to produce a new work commemorating the victims of the atomic bomb. She responded with the large-scale triptych Revived Soul. Unusually for the artist\'92s work of the period, the painting is drained of colour, featuring abstracted waving vertical bands of black and white that suggest a forest of desiccated trees, all covered in her signature polka dots.\

Elizabeth Catlett a Sculptor With Eye on Social Issues\uc0\u8232 
\b0 By Karen Rosenberg Apr 2 2012\
Biography not found\uc0\u8232 \
Elizabeth Catlett, whose abstracted sculptures of the human form reflected her deep concern with the African-American experience and the struggle for civil rights, died on Monday at her home in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where she had lived since the late 1940s. She was 96.\
June Kelly, one of her American dealers, said Ms. Catlett died in her sleep.\
In her smoothly modeled clay, wood and stone sculptures, and vigorous woodcuts and linocuts, Ms. Catlett drew on her experience as an African-American woman who had come of age at a time of widespread segregation and who had felt its sting. But her art had other influences, including pre-Columbian sculpture, Henry Moore\'92s sensuous reclining nudes and Diego Rivera\'92s political murals. \
Her best-known works depict black women as strong, maternal figures. In one early sculpture, \'93Mother and Child\'94 (1939), a young woman with close-cropped hair and features resembling a Gabon mask cradles a child against her shoulder. It won first prize in sculpture at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago. In a recent piece, \'93Bather\'94 (2009), a similar-looking subject flexes her triceps in a gesture of vitality and confidence. \
Her art did not exclude men; \'93Invisible Man,\'94 her 15-foot-high bronze memorial to the author Ralph Ellison, can be seen in Riverside Park in Manhattan, at 150th Street. \
\
Her art was often presented in the United States, in major surveys in the 1960s and \'9270s in particular, among them \'93Two Centuries of Black American Art,\'94 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1976. Her posters of Harriet Tubman, Angela Davis, Malcolm X and other figures were widely distributed.\
Alice Elizabeth Catlett was born on April 15, 1915, in Washington, the youngest of three children. Her mother, the former Mary Carson, was a truant officer; her father, John, who died before she was born, had taught at Tuskegee University and in the local public school system. \
Ms. Catlett became an educator, too. After graduating cum laude from Howard University in 1935, she taught high school in Durham, N.C. \
Howard hadn\'92t been her first choice. She had won a scholarship to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, in Pittsburgh, but the college refused to allow her to matriculate when it learned she was black. So she entered historically black Howard, with one semester\'92s worth of tuition saved by her mother. She earned scholarships to cover the rest. \
\
An interest in the painter Grant Wood led her to pursue an M.F.A. at the University of Iowa, where Wood was teaching. There she focused on stone carvings rooted in her own experience \'97 sensitive portraits of African-American women and children.\
After graduating she moved to New Orleans to teach at Dillard University, another historically black institution. There she organized a trip to the Delgado Museum of Art so that her students could see a Picasso exhibition. But this was no ordinary school trip; the museum was officially off-limits to blacks, so Ms. Catlett arranged to visit on a day when it was closed to the public.\
While on a summer break from Dillard, she met the artist Charles White in Chicago. They married in 1941 and divorced five years later. \uc0\u8232 She left New Orleans to study with the Russian-born sculptor Ossip Zadkine in New York. Mr. Zadkine, who spent his formative years in Montparnasse alongside Modigliani and Brancusi, nudged her work in a more abstract direction. During this time, the early 1940s, Ms. Catlett also worked in adult education at the George Washington Carver School in Harlem, a program that nurtured the photographer Roy DeCarava, among others.\
In 1946 Ms. Catlett traveled to Mexico on a fellowship. There she married the artist Francisco Mora and accepted an invitation to work at Taller de Gr\'e1fica Popular (TGP), a workshop in Mexico City for murals and graphic arts. The TGP inspired her to reach out to the broadest possible audience, which often meant balancing abstraction with figuration.\
\
\'93I learned how you use your art for the service of people, struggling people, to whom only realism is meaningful,\'94 she later said of this period.\
Like other artists and activists, Ms. Catlett felt the political tensions of the McCarthy years. The TGP was thought to have ties to the Communist Party; Ms. Catlett never joined the party, but Mr. White, her first husband, had been a member, and she was closely watched by the United States Embassy. \
In 1949 she was arrested, along with other expatriates, during a railroad workers\'92 strike in Mexico City. Eventually she gave up her American citizenship and was declared an undesirable alien by the State Department. In 1971 she had to obtain a special visa to attend the opening of her one-woman show at the Studio Museum in Harlem. \
Ms. Catlett continued to teach even after becoming a successful ar\uc0\u8232 tist. In 1958 she became the first female professor of sculpture and head of the sculpture department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico\'92s School of Fine Arts in Mexico City. She retired to Cuernavaca, about 35 miles southwest of Mexico City, in 1975. \u8232 Ms. Catlett\'92s art is in museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the High Museum in Atlanta; the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City; and the National Museum of Prague. In 2003, the International Sculpture Center gave her a lifetime achievement award.\
\
\
Mr. Mora, her husband, died in 2002. She is survived by three sons, Francisco, Juan and David Mora Catlett, 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. \
In 1998, the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College in Westchester County exhibited a 50-year retrospective of Ms. Catlett\'92s sculpture. The critic Michael Brenson wrote in the show\'92s catalog, \'93Ms. Catlett\'92s sculptures communicate a deeply human image of African-Americans while appealing to values and virtues that encourage a sense of common humanity.\'94 He also singled out the \'93fluid, sensual surfaces\'94 of her sculptures, which he said \'93seem to welcome not just the embrace of light but also the caress of the viewer\'92s hand.\'94\
In his review of that show for The New York Times, Ken Johnson wrote that Ms. Catlett \'93gives wood and stone a melting, almost erotic luminosity.\'94 But he also found her iconography \'93generic and clich\'e9d.\'94\
Last year, the Bronx Museum mounted \'93Stargazers: Elizabeth Catlett in Conversation With 21 Contemporary Artists,\'94 an exhibition that placed her sculptures, prints and drawings in the company of works by Ellen Gallagher, Kalup Linzy, Wangechi Mutu and others at the forefront of the contemporary art scene.\
In her own words, Ms. Catlett was more concerned with the social dimension of her art than its novelty or originality. As she told a former student, the artist and art historian Samella S. Lewis, \'93I have always wanted my art to service my people \'97 to reflect us, to relate to us, to stimulate us, to make us aware of our potential.\'94\uc0\u8232 \u8232
